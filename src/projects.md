  # Projects


  #### [Corona Culture](https://www.corona-culture.org/)

  Corona Culture explores this time of radical transformation through the lens of individual as well as collective cultures. In form of an exhibition, experiential event series and documentary film it captures perspectives on how the current pandemic affects our values, yearnings, ways of relating and future plans, revealing a mosaic of perspectives in the way we encounter uncertainty.


  #### [Menstruation Project](https://www.menstruation-project.com)

  The Menstruation Project is dedicated to raising awareness about the menstrual cycle, which symbolically stands for the universal rhythms of life as well as the long-suppressed feminine powers, and furthermore functions as an inner compass for one’s state of being. Beginning with a festival and documentary series, it aspires to educate and empower both menstruating and non-menstruating people alike, in order to reveal the cycle’s societal significance and advocate its integration into contemporary culture.
